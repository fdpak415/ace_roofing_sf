        <h3>Shingle Roof</h3>
        <p>These shingles consist of a core layer made from fiberglass mat,
        a layer of asphalt on both the top and bottom of the shingle, and
        a surface coating comprised of colored mineral granules. Composite
        shingles are available in many colors. Their typical lifespan is
        around 15-30 years. </p>

          <h3>Metal Roof</h3>
          <p>Compared to other roofs, metal roofs are the most durable and
          last a long time. Most metal roofs can be installed with a slope
          of 3:12 or greater. Metal roofs come in two general styles: vertical
          panels and interlocking shingle. We can provide you 30-50 years
          warranty on this style of roof. </p>

          <h3>Built-Up Roof</h3>
          <p>A waterproof membrane consisting of alternating layers of roofing
            fiberglass felt and hot asphalt. The typical system consists of
            a base sheet and two or three layers of ply sheets. A flood
            coat of hot asphalt is applied over the entire rooof and can
            be finished with a layer of clean pea gravel, a mineral-surfaced
            fiberglass cap sheet, or several reflective or elastometric coatings.
            The finish of the roof provides protection from ultraviolet sunrays,
            minimizes heat gain on the building, and gives the roof its required
            fire rating.  </p>
